# vim-deckset

Deckset is a mac application for rendering markdown as presentation. It has
a nifty feature of a preview window that can float on top of things. This
window can be scripted using AppleScript, and this plugin will change the
contents of the preview window as you move around in your presentation md file.

## Note

This is just a quick first stab at implementing this. It is by no means
complete yet, and does not currently support more than one presentation at
a time etc.
